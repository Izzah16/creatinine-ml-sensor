# Creatinine ML Sensor

A desktop application for creatinine quantification using electrochemical sensing combined with machine learning.

## Features
- Data acquisition from electrochemical sensor (via PalmSens SDK)
- Real-time plotting of DPV, CV, and EIS scans
- Automated feature extraction from raw DPV data
- Machine learning model (Random Forest) to predict creatinine concentration
- Calibration and result visualization interface (PyQt5 GUI)
